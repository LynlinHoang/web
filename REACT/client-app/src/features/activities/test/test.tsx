                    well, what i love about Finance is that it offers a range of career options
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    the skill sets of finance-related jobs are also transferrable, so you can easily switch to something else if want to
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    But gradually, I've grown fonder of the field. I know the
                    technical side of it can be quite daunting and off-putting to some people
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    As wonderfull as NEU is, I guess there are several things that leave a little to be
                    desired, like with most school
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    well, as I was saying, there are so many direction you can go when you're a finance major
                    and lately I've been gravitating toward banking
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    bank teller which I guess ca be quite mundane and repetitive
                </strong>
                <br />
                <strong>
                    you will advance quite quickly and maybe, with a bit a luck, climb to the position of bank manager
                    -that when the money starts rolling in
                </strong>

                <br />
                <strong>
                    I think the facilities are not quite up to par and the capcity of the learing
                    facilitis is not enough to accommodate the whole student pupulation
                </strong>
